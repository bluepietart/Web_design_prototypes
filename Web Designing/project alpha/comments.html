            <h2>A hermit growing a peach tree in and caring for it.</h2>
            <p>The image represents a hermit that has lived his kife in the world for a long time. The hermit was born a very wise and intellegent creature. Among it peers he alone was conidered the model of an ideal being.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aftre growing up and being a counslier for his fellow beings, he one day had an awakening. He saw that a great war would take place and all the people he cared for and the lands he lived will be destroyed. After having he realization he tried to stop it with any means nescassry to protect the things he cared for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He strived to end the problem peacfully as possible but he could not control the turmoil and eventually had the destruction fall upon his land. While he was strong and wise enough to fight aganist it, his very people he strived to protect sold him out to the enemy in effort to cease the war. This cruel betrayal soon enraged him to abandon his morals and became the carnage himself. He killed the very people he cared for, destroyed his land and other and roamed the lands around in search to seciate his bloodlust.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This went on until one day, he saw his refelcection by the river he he bend to drnk from it. It was at that moment he realised the awakening he saw back in the warning him of th egreat destruction was he himself. Having known th truth he broke down crying.
                <br>
                <p>The left the land and treaded into the mountains in search of a clarity to what his purpose was. He started to grow flowers and trees as this bought him peace and joy. The above seen drawing is a illustrtion of this very hermit. Living his life in search of his purpose.</p>
