                <h2>The Zenin Clan</h2>
                <p>A clan that existed since the age of jujutsu. Exact date or who the clan originated was never mentioned but is belived to as old as 200 years from the great heian era of jujutsu socery. The leaders born into this clan are born with the inherate technique the 'Ten Shadow' technique. The users are given 2 diven dogs are are able to summon 10 shikigami which the socceser has to exorcise to tame them to be able to summon them and use as you will. The shikigamis are created from the users shadow and the user can summon up to 10 shadows. Each shadow is unique in thier forms and powers they have, Because of how verstile and the utlity provided by the technique and also the stupidly broken powers from the shikigams make the user of this technique be as strong to rival the Gojo clan in terms of power. Gaining the seat of one the 3 big clans in the jujutsu history the user is regared as one of the strongest socessor. </p>

                <h2>All the shikigami of the technique</h2>
                <p>The first shikigami the user gets is kind of frebee with it the user has to excorsis all the showds summoned in the ritual. The ritual can be done by multiple people to take par in it but if an outsider interferas or defets the shadow, the ritual becomes null. Once excorsied the shikigamis can be summoned by the user whenever he desires to aid him in his battle. Also thier powers could be ascessed without them being present. Once a the shikigami dies in battle its gone for ever and never be used agin. Insted the dead shikigamis powers get transfered to the other shadows.</p>

                <p>Like mentioned previously when a shikigami dies its powers get transfered to the other shikigamis empowering them and making them stronger. Known fusions of the shikigami are divine dog: totality Demon Dog and nue: totality Agito.</p>

                <h2>Known Users Of the Technique</h2>
                <p>AT the point in the manga are Fushigiro Megumi.aka.Zenin also current zenin head of the clan and the other known user is suprisingly Sukuna.aka. fraudkuna. The king of curses from 1000 years ago also regared as the 2 strongest character in the story after Gojo. A sore loser who fights with other people stuffs....No other users are mentioned in name execpt by Gojo when advicing megumi about the previous head of the zenin clan who also was the holder of the ten shadoe technique 300 years ago who died fighting the head of Gojo cla that time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col col-1 col-bg">
                <p>The ten shadow technique when used by megumi was a joke. He really did not know ehat he was doing and just running around underdevelped. Until sukuna took over the technique and showed how broken the technique is. If anyone else fought him, if his name aint Gojo they are gonna lose 100%. No questions asked.</p>
