Just some coded web pages with html and css. No domain, local. 
Hello to anyone reading, 
These are just some web pages made in my spare time. I am open to suggestions. Please let me know if there is any bugs to fix. All knowlege on this is self taught. Thanks for checking out.
Need to have any editor to see the code snippits or to change any. Though i prefer using visual studios code. Also open the .html files to see the pages. To open the code right click the html page and hit open with proceed to open with visaul studio code.
